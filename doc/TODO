Miscellaneous
  Why doesn't (function ($) {})(jQuery); work with tablesort.js in ping.js?

Ideas
  Too many areas of the program know explicitly about the structure of the 
  match database. Without wrapping EVERYTHING in calls to localize to 
  lib/practiscore.js, is there a better way to handle it? 

  For now, using the data as read-only anywhere is acceptable, but anything
  that alters data needs to be put in lib/practiscore.js and a function 
  exposed to manipulate it.
